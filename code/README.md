# Wild and Scenic Rivers GIS â€“ April 2019

These Python notebooks rely on data from the [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography), downloaded from the [National Map](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/?basemap=b1&category=nhd&title=NHD%20View#startUp).

The [final product](http://www.visualizingwild.land/2019/04/05/the-john-dingell-jr-acts-wild-scenic-rivers/) does not use the California data generated by this software, but does include augmentation for the northeast region. The source geographic data for California was provided by our partners, and the source data for New England was derived from locations specified in the original location. Both raw sources are available upon request.
